"Empirical knowledge is always fuzzy! And theoretical knowledge, like all the laws of physics, as of todayâ€™s date, is always wrong-in detail, though possibly providing some very good approximations indeed"â€“ *John Tukey, The Philosophy of Multiple Comparisons, Statistical Science, 1991, 6, 100-116*

My work firstly is about **Inferring** patterns from some finite sample with the humility to recognise that such patterns have no obligations to conform to my research and may themselves be changing with time. To put it a bit more technically, all of analysis is about function approximation of some latent data generation process which may well be non stationary either in time or some other parameter


Then my motivation is about effective communication where I try to

**1) Know My Audience** &rarr;  **2) Involve Stakeholders Early and Iterate** &rarr;  **3) Focus on "What, Why, How and Now What"** &rarr; **4) Emphasize Value and Impact of the "Now What"** &rarr; **5) Quantify Benefits with the uncertainity**


My repos are prototypical replications of projects undertaken in various orgs to better explain my work

I am an ex programmer spending the first 2 years of my career developing Software so i am neither impressed nor intimidated by the plethora of new data tools that keep getting marketed as **'Must have'**. However, since tools are useful for doing actual productive work, here is a list of tools/platforms i have used most:

<br>**Programming Languages**</br>
| Language | Usage |
| --- | --- |
| ![Page_1](https://github.com/SubhraSMukherjee/SubhraSMukherjee/blob/main/screenshots/python.png) | Naturally as with any General-Purpose Language I have used python for almost everything, from modelling to experimentation setup to orchestrating pipelines to creating customised platform independent dashboards. Also, Querying No-Sql Databases  |
| ![Page_1](https://github.com/SubhraSMukherjee/SubhraSMukherjee/blob/main/screenshots/SQL.png) | Yes and Yes, I use SQL regularly and am proficient at it have used all sorts of dialects (Google SQL, Databricks SQL, Snowflake SQL, My SQL, PLSQL). SQL is extremely useful but only in the context of an RDBMS   |
| ![Page_1](https://github.com/SubhraSMukherjee/SubhraSMukherjee/blob/main/screenshots/bash.png) | Bash and Powershell for containerization, writing small utilitarian server side scripts  |


*As a Software Developer my TechStack used to be predominantly JAVA and C, the knowledge of which makes me a very technically sound Analyst/Scientist/Consultant*
