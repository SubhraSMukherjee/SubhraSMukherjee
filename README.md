"Empirical knowledge is always fuzzy! And theoretical knowledge, like all the laws of physics, as of todayâ€™s date, is always wrong-in detail, though possibly providing some very good approximations indeed"â€“ *John Tukey, The Philosophy of Multiple Comparisons, Statistical Science, 1991, 6, 100-116*

I am just trying to **infer** patterns from some finite sample with the full awareness that such patterns have no obligations to conform to my research and may themselves be changing with time. To put it a bit more technically, all of analysis is about function approximation of some latent data generation process which may well be non stationary either in time or some other parameter


Since the Tools are useful for doing actual productive work, here is a list of the Tools i use most often:

<br>**Programming Languages**</br>
| Language | Description |
| --- | --- |
| git status | List all new or modified files |
| git diff | Show file differences that haven't been staged |
