"Empirical knowledge is always fuzzy! And theoretical knowledge, like all the laws of physics, as of todayâ€™s date, is always wrong-in detail, though possibly providing some very good approximations indeed"â€“ *John Tukey, The Philosophy of Multiple Comparisons, Statistical Science, 1991, 6, 100-116*
